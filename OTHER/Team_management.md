## About Team Management

#### Stand up meeting everyday, 5 mins
1. Sync the process of projects, to make sure not reach out to the ETA. If something pending, we can make a plan to action first, the badest case we can notice to business that the project maybe delay in early time.
2. Sync the status of every team member to avoid someone has problems that cannot be solved by themselves.
3. A way to comunicate with team members to check their status.

#### Short talk with team members every month
Since communicate with team members is very important, about work, their life. Maybe you can do nothing with their life, but you may know the status, somehow you will get some messages may help you to manage you team.
1. Talk about work, life.
2. If they have any advise for you.
3. They think what's not good and what's need to improve, even about the company.

#### Make yourself low position
Don't always make yourself as a leader, all of us are equal in the world, so it doesn't make sense that you feel yourself stand high above the masses. Ofcouse sometime, your team member make some mistake, the better way is have a long conversion with him or her to summary the mistake, and then remind others not make the same mistake in a meeting.

#### More comunication with business
Make sure yourself understand the business of project clearly, then you can lead the project to the right way. Don't accept requirement without evaluation.

#### Fight for your team members
Try your best to give the benifits to your team members, if you think some members don't work well, you should also have problems, so don't blame you members without thinking about yourself.
